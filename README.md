# React + TypeScript + Vite Project

This project is a modern web application built using React, TypeScript, and Vite. It leverages the power of React for building user interfaces, TypeScript for adding static type definitions to JavaScript, and Vite for an optimized and fast development experience.

## Installation

To install the project dependencies, run:

```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
pnpm test
```

## Configuration

- **Vitest Configuration**: The testing configuration is defined in `vitest.config.ts` which sets up the environment and global settings for tests.
- **Playwright Configuration**: The end-to-end testing configuration is in `playwright.config.ts`, specifying test directories, parallel execution, and browser settings.

## Code Quality

- **ESLint**: The project uses ESLint for linting, with configurations specified in `eslint.config.js`. It helps maintain code quality and consistency across the project.

## Mock Data

Mock data for users is available in `src/mockData/users.ts` for testing purposes. This allows for the simulation of real data fetching scenarios during development and testing.

```
pnpm dev
```

### Reasons for Technology Choices

- **Vite**: Chosen for its fast hot module replacement (HMR), significantly improving the development experience by enabling instant feedback on code changes.
- **Vitest**: Selected for testing because it offers a Jest-like experience with Vite's native ES modules support, making it faster and more efficient for modern JavaScript projects.
- **Playwright**: Used for end-to-end testing to ensure that the application behaves as expected in real-world scenarios across different browsers. It provides reliable automation and supports advanced testing needs.
- **Zustand**: A minimalistic state management solution that simplifies state logic in React applications. It's chosen for its simplicity, ease of use, and performance benefits.
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Utilized for fetching, caching, and updating data in React applications. It simplifies data fetching and state management with efficient caching and background updates, improving user experience and application performance.
